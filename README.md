## About

Acoustigram.io is a music recommendation site so that users have a place to go to keep up with the latest music releases. We use a combination of Machine Learning and the user's Spotify Account data to create playlists of new music releases that are similar to music that the user listens to on Spotify.


## UX/UI Design

I wanted to create a light/delicate interface for the user to interact with. Using bold type only for headers or to grab the user's attention. The majority of the type is light. Two typefaces are used, Volkhov serif for descriptions/headers and apple sans serif for body text. All type is of the same color to keep things unified.

Bordered containers of content and buttons create a theme that structures information in a modular and consistent way, as well as helps to add to the theme of delicate since it's only a 1px border.

The color gradient background was custom made in Illustrator to create an element of playfulness and depth.
